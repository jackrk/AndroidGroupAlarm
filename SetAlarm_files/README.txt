NOT a full project/application.

Activities, manifest, and JavaScript interface included, as well as res and assets directories in case you want to copy this code to a project and run my input form.

The webview has a simple form with working day and offset selectors, and an input box for the alarm time.

Recurring alarm may not work, I forget. One-time alarm definitely works.

When alarm goes off, a new activity is spun up so that we can execute code when the user 'snoozes' or 'stops' the alarm.
